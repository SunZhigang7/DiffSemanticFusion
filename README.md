# DiffSemanticFusion

This is the official release of SemanticFusion, Our approach reasons over a semantic raster–fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations.

We are going to release code step by step:

- [x] Mapless QCNet 
- [x] Mapless QCnet with Online HD Map Diffusion
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion Base
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion + Sparse4D Sparse
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion + Sparse Graph
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion

Note: Due to policy, SemanticFormer can't be open source, so we only open source homogeneous graph fusion with BEV
