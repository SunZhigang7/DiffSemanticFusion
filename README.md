# DiffSemanticFusion
![github_diffsemanticfusion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bba0baa-252b-4be9-af3c-26f92c9f2f9b)

This is the official release of DiffSemanticFusion, Our approach reasons over a semantic rasterâ€“fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations.

We are going to release code step by step:

- [x] Mapless QCNet 
- [x] Mapless QCnet with Online HD Map Diffusion
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion Base
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion + Sparse4D Sparse
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion + Sparse Graph
- [ ] DiffSemanticFusion

Note: Due to policy, SemanticFormer can't be open source, so we only open source homogeneous graph fusion with BEV
